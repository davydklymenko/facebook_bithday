                Facebook is a social networking service originally launched as TheFacebook on February 4, 2004, before
                changing its name to simply Facebook in August 2005.[1] It was founded by Mark Zuckerberg and his college
                roommates and fellow Harvard University students, in particular Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin
                Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.[2] The website's membership was initially limited by the founders to Harvard
                students, but was expanded to other colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League,[3] and gradually most
                universities in the United States and Canada,[4][5] corporations,[6] and by September 2006, to everyone with
                a valid email address along with an age requirement of being 13 or older.</p>
